Lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. I then start to act weird because I'm trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they don't know that I'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I'm a threat because of it.    I'm not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid. I like kids and don't know why I'm so scared to be around them.    I don't understand why I feel like this. Am I a bad person? How do I make this stop?",

      "My ex-boyfriend is with someone new, and it hurts  I just got out of a two year relationship. I broke up with my boyfriend because he wasn't showing any affection at all. He was talking to other women and lying about it. It pushed me away and hurt me, but I'm still in love with him. A couple days after our breakup, he was talking to someone new. He told me he wasn't sure if he loved me. I cried for several days, lost my appetite, and couldn't sleep. Our whole relationship was only us. We didn't have friends. It was me and him against the world. We didn't talk to anyone else because we only wanted to talk to each other. We hung out constantly and Skyped to sleep every single night. Then, when I cut myself, we talked on Skype. He cried and told me \"I'm still in love with you, I never stopped loving you,\" and I cried tears of joy. I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasn't just saying that because of me being so depressed. He promised and assured me he loved me. He came over after that, and we had sex because he wanted to. He went the home that night and told me he didn't love me, and he lied because he was scared. He told me I wasn't attractive, I wasn’t beautiful to him, and that I changed. He also told me he was 100% sure he'd never love me again. I'm still in love with him. Why do I love him? How do I stop? Just knowing that someone else is with him hurts me. That I wasn't good enough and that I'm no longer beautiful hurts me. I think I need a therapist, but don't know if I should.",

I had found out about a month before, but I hadn't told him I knew because I didn't want us to break up. I used to have very low self-esteem, and I think it might have to do with my dad being an alcoholic. My father cheated on my mother when I was little. I wonder if this pain has to do with that. My ex-boyfriend and I were only dating for five months, but I still can't get over this betrayal. I'm not sure what to feel to get over it: forgiveness? Hate? He helped me financially after our break up by lending me $3000, so I'm grateful for that. I still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although we're not even talking anymore. We follow each other on Instagram and that's it. I feel like I still need his validation. This is haunting me day and night. I want to focus on my new relationship and goals, but I keep obsessing over this and keep checking my ex-boyfriend's Instagram and Facebook. I feel so bad and keep having nightmares.",

Things kinda returned to normal few weeks later. Last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. Intimacy fell off. I asked what's up. She says she can't connect with anyone and that it's not me. She used to be very open and expressive. Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off.

He lives three hours away and likes the reassurance of having someone to talk to multiple times per day and seeing me once or twice a month. I want someone who is more present and more of a life companion. Lately, he has had a very busy work schedule and I have only seen him a few times in the last 6 weeks. I told him that I can't continue in this way because I constantly feel frustrated and angry and that he is not making the relationship enough of a priority. I also feel it is keeping me from possibly finding the relationship I want. We have been together 7 years. The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like. We have gone through this cycle already 4-5 times and I feel it is unhealthy to stay in it, but my aversion to the anxiety and depression I experience upon separation always leads me to reconcile.",

I only have two people in my life - my best friend and my wife.    My mother forced my father out of my life so I do not know who he really is. We've gotten in contact but he just makes comments on how much I look like her when in fact I look more like him. This makes me mad because I don't want to look like my mother. I hate her. All that she did was bring me down and make me homeless, which she was successful at. I need guidance in my life.

      "I frequently struggle with maintaining my mood and during the day I can fluctuate and find myself very over emotional, crying at pretty much any trigger.",
      "Since my initial breakdown in 2017 I have learnt to live with these episodes and they are often triggered when I do something for the first time and these episodes can sometimes last months in which I am unable to function besides getting up and lying in bed or sitting in my living room all day.",
      "I try and do small things such as making my bed or standing in my garden for 5 minutes and I find these help improve my mood for 5 or so minutes before I am back to feeling like I am in a pit of despair and dread.",
      "I am in receipt of ESA due to my conditions impacting my ability to go out and being able to do simple tasks as sometimes my panic episodes can last the entire day where I am unable to speak sentences properly or perform simple things like turning the oven on because it all overwhelms me.",
      "I have noticed over the last 3 years of my anxiety and panic episodes (times when they are much worse than normal, and normal is still quite debilitating as I feel like I am a ticking time bomb until my next inevitable panic episode) that I am always brought back to thoughts of school.",
      "I am always thinking about my school life and this has definitely been on my mind the most during any and all attacks.",
      "I have some good and bad memories of school and I have expressed on the forum a few times of the fact I was a target of serious and prolonged bullying during my later years in school (around the ages of 12-15) and these never really phased me beyond the immediate shock of getting attacked and the nervousness I had of going to school.",
      "I have spoken to therapists about these and they all agree that these could definitely play a role into my self-confidence issues as well as my GAD.",
      "Although, sometimes I doubt if they do because to this day the thoughts do not particularly distress me when I think of them outside of my panic attacks but they are certainly terrifying during one!",
      "There is another thing that I did in school that really affected me and knocked my mental health off for 2 years.",
      "I watched a hypnosis video on YouTube (of which I can't remember the title) and this was a video I watched on my old laptop before I went to bed.",
      "I watched it just out of idle curiosity as the title got my interest.",
      "I thought nothing of it and went to sleep (I was 13 at the time) and I woke up the next day with a foggy head and everything just felt 'off' as if I wasn't 100% awake.",
      "I thought nothing of it being the age I was and just got dressed and went to school but over the day nothing would lift this mental fog that was clouding me, I was so unmotivated and couldn't think properly as the words just wouldn't form in my head to sentences.",
      "I would often forget the names of objects such as chairs or teachers names and this just spiralled my anxiety about this mental fog (at this point the hypnosis video I watched wasn't even in my head because it was just filled with worry about the fact I couldn't think properly) and I began to get really depressed.",
      "I lost next to all my motivation and I just haven't been the same since - even to this day.",
      "I went for a Doctor's appointment after talking with my mam about how I couldn't deal with the foggy head and general forgetfulness (these were my only symptoms other than these everything else in life was fine) and the doctor told me I had stress and sent me on my with with no further check-up or appointments.",
      "Which, at the age of 14 now, was just opening doors to so much more questions as I didn't even feel stressed apart from being stressed about the fact I thought I had dementia!",
      "I had to deal with this awful feeling of not being quite right and I became more reserved than normal, I lost my spark in life and everything was just so grey.",
      "By the time I finished school, I was gradually forgetting about the foggy thoughts and I don't quite remember when they lifted although my earliest memory of feeling 'normal' was September 2015 which was the day I started college at 16.",
      "Throughout college I was quite happy and I have talked with my therapist frequently about college being the last period in life I felt truly happy with life.",
      "I had made a lot of friends and I found the socialising really lifted my mood in retrospect and I was really fulfilled being in that routine and I have expressed times where I just wish I could spend the rest of my life that way, however unrealistic that idea is.",
      "I finished college with an offer at University and I felt the nerves of University during my application process and over the summer holidays but they were never anything I would have deemed serious at the time and chalked it up to the nerves a lot of us face when taking the plunge.",
      "However, on the first day I was overcome with the absolute worst anxiety I had ever faced.",
      "I felt like vomiting the whole morning (I loathe the idea of vomiting and I do my absolute ALL to keep it in) and my stomach had the worst butterflies and it kept feeling like someone was hitting my stomach with a mallet the pains were that extraordinary.",
      "I was at the toilet nearly 10 times during the day because everything was just going right through me, I lost my appetite completely and had to make the call to drop out after crying in my room for 4 hours after the first day.",
      "After this the rest is history and I have been in and out of many different clinics and therapist rooms looking for an answer as to why my life has been this way ever since.",
      "There are steps I have learnt to take such as getting more exercise and cleaning my room as often as I can (I manage making my bed daily and hoovering every few days) and these help keep me occupied and hopefully 'doing normal human things'.",
      "I just cannot shake the thoughts of that video I watched about the hypnosis.",
      "I feel like I have quite literally ruined my life watching that video and all I wish to do is find the video so I can know what the hell it has done to me.",
      "I think it could be a  thought triggered by my anxiety but the timing of it and all that went on the literal day after make me really question what it was.",
      "TL;DR -    Watched a hypnosis video when I was 13 (2013), had awful brain fog for years.",
      "It managed to clear but had a breakdown in 2017 which brings all my thoughts back to my school life.",
      "Was bullied heavily during my school life.",

      "Since the other night i have that constant feeling that it&#39;s going to stop at any moment and when i breathe out it feels like my heart has stopped and a huge surge of adrenaline rushes through my body when i breathe in.</p><p></p><p>Although i should i haven&#39;t been back to the doctors as i feel like i&#39;m just over reacting and i would like to see if anyone here had experienced the same problems as i have here</p>",

      "Hello,      Since the turn of the year, I have been experiencing various problems with my breathing.",
      "Shortly after New Year, I first became aware of these issues.",
      "The best way I can describe it is that I feel that I constantly need to take a deep \"satisfying\" breath otherwise my breathing will become very shallow - almost as if i am not fully filling my lungs as I inhale.",
      "Basically every morning since the new year, I've woken up in a coughing fit that just drags on until I shower and blow my nose.",
      "After that I will just have this awareness/feeling that I need to take a deep breath constantly throughout the day and feel heart palpitations regularly throughout.",
      "I regularly wake up in the middle of the night feeling exactly like this - this worries me as I fear that it is not anxiety causing it but something else as I haven't had the chance to think about it.",
      "I initially panicked as these feelings was totally alien to me when it first occurred so I went to hospital and they tested for COVID19, took a chest x-ray and an ECG and all came back clear.",
      "I have visited my GP twice since then and he thinks it is due to anxiety, having taken the pulse oximeter test and another ECG.",
      "I originally thought it was some form of delayed side affect from damaging my back in November (which was debilitating but have since gained majority of movement, although pain still lingers - I was not able to get diagnosed for this injury as it was a phone consultation but was prescribed cocodamol and diazepam (which i didnt use).",
      "On recommendation from my doctor, over the last few months I have been reading CBT books, practicing mindfulness, various techniques for breathing, yoga, running/cardio and had previously been prescribed propanolol but nothing seems to be having an effect.",
      "I feel like i need to speak to a doctor again/be checked for other reasons this may be happening but fear I may be wasting their time.",
      "I am male, 27 years old, 6'4, average weight and a generally shy/anxious person      I suppose my main questions are should I be worried about something more physical than purely anxiety, should I return to the doctor to see if there is anything else they can do to help and is there anyone else that has experienced this before.",
      "(cw: pretty long) hello everyone,  i'm new to 7cups, but it looked promising for help, so i think i'll try it out.",
      "the reason i'm posting today is the same as the reason in the title: i have no idea what i'm supposed to do.",
      "for context, i'm currently 16, and i have a lot of problems with social anxiety and depression.",
      "i also have problems with avoiding school, as it is probably the biggest source of anxiety for me.",
      "this behavior got me put in an alternative school around the eighth grade, which i'm still currently attending.",
      "my parents know the reason why i got transferred, and they hold the whole situation against me, often at random.",
      "they get very upset that my home district hasn't transfered me back yet; but in the about 3-4 years i've been attending this school, they haven't once helped me try to get professional help.",
      "i've been in a psych ward before, a little while before i got transferred, but that situation is never talked about (unless my parents want to use it to snap at me), and that, along with some state mandated therapy appointments (via dcfs), were the only times that i've seen a professional.",
      "and now, all of my problems seem to flaring up again as school starts.",
      "i want help, because i know that when i get like this, it's a while before i can recalibrate.",
      "i can't do my work, find myself crying almost daily, end up either over or under eating, and dread getting up in the morning.",
      "right now, i have a counselor at school, and i do think she helps me, but i'm only scheduled to see her once a week for a relatively short 15-30 minutes, and i don't think that's something i can change.",
      "there's also things i'm not comfortable admitting at school, as i'm generally not comfortable with the environment.",
      "where do i go from here?",
      "i could try to schedule my own appointment through a clinic, but i'm not knowledgeable about the medical system, and over the phone therapy in my home wouldn't be the best option.",
      "i could also try and reason with my parents, but their track record of either ignoring me, outright denying that there's a problem at all, or bringing up religion (which is something that does not help at all, and almost always makes me worse), doesn't look promising.",
      "i'm so lost and would greatly appreciate if anyone has any advice.",
      "i'm not sure how long i can keep shoving things down and carry on with school.",
      "thanks for reading, and sorry that this is so long.",
      "Hi all, I’m here just looking for suggestions, advice or just an understanding voice.",
      "I’m a 34 year old male and just over one month ago started to have many physical and mental symptoms of an anxiety or panic surge.",
      "The problem is that they have been relatively constant throughout this entire time.",
      "The symptoms consist mainly of      -severe anxiety that can turn to dread   -a “crawling out of my skin” feeling   -inner restlessness   -general weakness and stiffness   -constant sweating in the palms and soles   -intermittent numbness and tingling in the legs, hands and face   -loss of appetite   -“lump in the back of the throat” feeling and mild nausea   -heat or cold intolerance   -a general sense of hyper alertness or awareness   -a feeling of malaise or sickness      If these symptoms came in distinct episodes lasting a few minutes to an hour, I may be a bit more relieved.",
      "However the problem is that these symptoms have been present virtually all day, every day in the last month.",
      "The severity can fluctuate but never truly go away to the point that I have ever felt “at baseline”.",
      "These symptoms are most severe in the morning and I can wake up with them or they crash in like a wave in seconds and can last hours.",
      "The anxiety can lessen a little towards the evening/night but other times they get worse and prevent me from sleeping.",
      "I cannot tolerate anything that increases adrenaline even in the slightest.",
      "If I start watching a thriller or take just a sip of coffee, the anxiety drives me over the edge to the point I cannot sit still and must get up and pace.",
      "Just over a month ago I used to drink coffee without any problems.",
      "The feelings of inner restlessness and anxiety can make my job very difficult, which requires me to basically sit in front of a computer all day long.",
      "However, most concerning is that even on a boring weekend, with absolutely nothing going on, I can try to surf the web or read a book and the symptoms will still be there.",
      "The strangest symptom has to be the sweaty palms.",
      "There never seems to be a moment in the day when my palms are not drenched with sweat.",
      "I have started Lexapro 5 mg a week ago and am still waiting for any effect.",
      "The only thing that brings relief is a low dose of Klonopin (no surprise) that can last a few hours at most.",
      "Common lab work, including thyroid, have been normal thus far.",
      "Any words of advice, suggestions, or encouragement would truly be appreciated.",
      "I have been alternately fearful, disbelieving, angry, and depressed the whole time and do not know for how many more months to come.",
      "My anxiety attacks are sometimes followed up with 24 to 36 hours of brain fog, weakness, tinnitus, and headache and confusion.",
      "It's intermittent.",
      "Sometimes once or twice a week.",
      "Sometimes a week or two without these symptoms.",
      "Does anyone else experience anything similar?",
      "I can have a few good days and then I am bombarded with these symptoms.",
      "I can deal with the butterflies in the stomach and overall nervousness but these occasional symptoms are down right crippling.",
      "Can anyone relate?",
      "I am currently dealing with childhild abuse.",
      "My mum has never shown she cares about this issue considering it was a family member i was abused by.",
      "As she was abused by her brother when she was a child as well.",
      "I had a few traumatic relationships over the years.",
      "I never felt the support of my parents or understanding growing up and to add to that dealing with rejection, abandonment and anxiety issues from relationships.",
      "I recently started dating someone.",
      "I was anxious about dating but he must have gotten into my head.",
      "We werent dating for long before he told me out of the blue we would be better as friends.",
      "This has been extremely traumatising because he made me believe that i was actually worth it.",
      "He was the luckiest guy.",
      "He really liked me.",
      "Everything seemed botmal one day then the next it was all unexpected.",
      "Some of my friends dont seem to understand.",
      "None is around for me but when they need someone im always the person to put everything down.",
      "So to not have your own mother care about your situation, to go through the same issue with relationships over again.",
      "All i have experienced is abandonment and disappointment and shown that my feelings are not valid.",
      "How am i meant to continue like this.",
      "Yesterday i cried in bed all afternoon  woke up through the night crying  and so far today cried in bed all morning.",

      "ive never told anybody about this before.",
      "ill probably never tell anyone i know, but i feel like i need to let it out.",
      "so, when i was six, my mom joined some sort of church group, im not sure what it wad exactly, but it met in someone's house.",
      "anyway, she would bring me and my sister (we're twins), and let us play with the other kids.",
      "they were mostly our age, but there was an older kid named Jeremy.",
      "he was kinda creepy, he never really talked to us and he was always watching me and my sister.",
      "most people couldn't tell us apart, and it took my mom awhile to figure out who was who, because we had the same haircut.",
      "even as we got older, when i was eleven, we looked very similar.",
      "that day, he tried to take my sister but he grabbed me, so i ended up being taken to his room alone.",
      "i tried to yell but he pulled out a knife, which he had alot of around his room, and told me if i yelled he'd kill me.",
      "i started crying quietly and he did alot of horrible things to me, until he figured out i was a boy.",
      "he got angry then, and it got so much worse after that.",
      "it lasted about three hours, i think.",
      "i never told anyone, and he kept doing it, and i let him because otherwise he'd take my sister.",
      "i didnt really understand that it was wrong, either, id never heard of this before.",
      "i just lived with it.",
      "it stopped when i was 16, when we moved states.",
      "ive had a couple other run ins with people like that, even a couple months ago, but nothing as long and horrible.",
      "i still have nightmares about it, and im scared because my mom is thinking about moving back, and she's still friends with his family, so there would probably be an obligatory meeting.",
      "everyone thought we were friends, too, since i was always in his room.",

      "I had no job, and had gotten out two toxic relationships that have left me mentally depleted.",
      "I was down and always thinking it was going to remain this way.",
      "All I could do was cry and beat myself up mentally thinking that I was never going to amount to anything (words that came from her bio dad).",
      "Then one day, I was blessed with a job, but that was short lived, because I was becoming emotionally depleted and down again from the constant dehumanizing from her bio dad.",
      "I lost myself for a moment.",
      "Then a couple of months later, I decided it was time for a change.",
      "I started to exercise, journal, repeat daily affirmations and move in with my grandparents for the time being.",

      "As I was beginning to climb that treacherous mountain of healing, I noticed a trend those so called \"friends\" all carried, they all never wanted to get the help for themselves that they needed and enjoyed swimming in their own chaos.",

      "Sometimes, even just a few hours before showering I won't be able to stop thinking about it, it's like my brain keeps anticipating it and reminding me to not forget about it.",
      "However the problem is that to my understanding, OCD is about repeatedly carrying out rituals or compulsions that are irrational, however showering daily is definitely a rational and normal thing to do, and it's not like I am showering multiple times a day to feel clean, thus I am stuck with the question \"is this really OCD?\" I find that after cleaning, I feel immediately relieved, no longer dizzy, like everything is at ease and I can continue with my work again.",
      "Sometimes I even shower earlier before the set time just so that I can be free of the obsessive thoughts later on.",
      "It's definitely mind bogging because my brain knows it's something justifiable and that I have to eventually do it anyways, so it can fully control and convince me.",

      "It all started from my first &#39;Panic attack&#39; well that&#39;s what everyone says it to be but I seem to convince myself otherwise.",
      "Basically this is what happened...",
      "I remember being fine one minute but after walking up the stairs my chest felt weird, it&#39;s hard to explain but out of no where my heart rapidly sped up, it didn&#39;t gradually speed up either it was just all of a sudden.",
      "I have never felt my heart beat so fast before!?",
      "but at that moment I just lied on the floor holding my chest and all that was going through my mind was &quot;I&#39;m going to die&quot; &quot;I&#39;m going to go into cardiac arrest&quot; &quot;Am I having a heart attack?&quot; This was the scariest thing I have ever experienced.",
      "Then all of a sudden it calmed down, but again it didn&#39;t just gradually calm down it felt as if my heart stopped for a second then it started beating normal straight after.",
      "I then lied down and was started shaking for about 20 minutes (obviously in fear).",
      "I think I was shook up for the whole night after.",

      "but the thing that came up was anxiety and panic attacks.",
      "Before this has happened I knew I struggled with some sort of anxiety because I was a bit of an anxious person before this anyway, with people and other stuff so I kinda just thought yeah there can&#39;t be anything wrong with me because I was only 16 at the time so I blew it off, but it was still constantly on my mind.",
      "Soon I started getting proper bad panic attacks, but this was different as my heart would beat fast but not like it did the first time, I would also ***** out, shake and get heart palpitations and more again I would feel like I am going to die, when it happened it was scary but when I googled it a lot of websites said anxiety attacks.",
      "I started getting these more often, it started of as weekly then became daily and this happened most of the summer and September of last year.</p><p></p><p>I avoided going to the doctors but I found these lumps in the side of my neck back in august and these started to grow and get bigger so I eventually in November went to see a doctor and I also mentioned about these &#39;panic attacks&#39; at the time and she said that it did sound like panic attacks and diagnosed me with anxiety disorder.",
      "I had every blood test under the sun to see what these lumps where but they all came back fine and an ultrasound showed that these lumps are just my glands that are up and they have been up for a year now and no one knows why?",
      "Can anxiety cause this?",
      "but before this they misdiagnosed me a few times telling me that I had glandular fever and other stuff wrong with me but when I had blood tests done this showed that I didn&#39;t have anything wrong with me.",
      "The reason I am mentioning this because I do not trust my doctors much lmao.</p><p></p><p>All of the above is how it started but this is what I&#39;m like now and I am just getting worse.</p><p></p><p>I can physically see my pulse move on my wrist, this was quite weird to me but since I have noticed this I constantly on a daily basis check my pulse, anywhere I can feel my pulse I check it, even when I&#39;m out I&#39;m constantly feeling my neck, my wrist or looking at my wrist, and I can say without a doubt I have done this several times a day for nearly a year and a half, sometimes my pulse is weaker then it should be, sometimes it&#39;s normal and other times my pulse is fast and its driving me INSANE.</p><p></p><p>I feel like I have a heart problem, I suffer from persistent chest pain nearly every day, the type of pain varies.",
      "Sometimes my heart feels very tight, other times there&#39;s a sharp pain.",

      "People would be like it&#39;s just a panic attack but this comes out of no where most of the time and doesn&#39;t feel like my normal panic attacks where I have loads of symptoms.",
      "Other times it wouldn&#39;t be this painful but I would still think there&#39;s something wrong with my heart.",
      "I also sometimes suffer from pain down the left side of my arm with it, which again convinces me there&#39;s something wrong.</p><p></p><p>I also suffer from heart palpitations sometimes, like I can feel a couple of my heart beats, or my heart speeds up for a couple seconds.</p><p></p><p>I get shortness of breath, a lot of the time I feel as if I&#39;m struggling to breathe, which again is telling me that there is something not right.",
      "This usually comes with the chest pain etc but can sometimes occur on its own.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I have been to the doctors numerous of times about this, they have never sent me to a cardiologist before but I eventually got an ECG test done a couple months back, the results came back but i&#39;m still not satisfied.",
      "I read online that ECG tests aren&#39;t very accurate as they only tests your heart for a few seconds, and my heart and chest felt normal okay when I was getting tested.",
      "I also get told a lot that I am too young to have a heart problem but I&#39;ve also read about how young people my age or even younger have died from cardiac arrest due to heart disease even if they have had tests done.",
      "Some websites say certain tests don&#39;t show certain heart diseases as well so what if the doctors are missing something?",
      "I know I shouldn&#39;t google things but sometimes I can&#39;t help myself.</p><p></p><p>About once a month my heart rapidly speeds up all of a sudden (As I mentioned previously) this has happened before by sitting up, lying down, bending down, standing up and has happened when I&#39;ve been running but can also happen out of no where, when it happens my heart feels like it stops then beats extremely fast and before it goes to normal my heart will feel like it&#39;s stopped for a second again..",
      "its awful.",

      "Then all of a sudden it felt like I was coming out of my body, like I was still in my body but I couldn&#39;t feel myself properly, this was a scary experience.",
      "I think this is called depersonalization.",

      "You need your protection against the cold, and in this case, the cold is the part of your mind that is telling you that what you are doing is the right thing to do.",
      "One of the best ways to start your treatment is to be able to tell which voice is speaking to you.",
      "Is it your disorder telling you to purge, or is it the sane voice telling you that you need to stop and get help.",
      "One thing that helps is every thought you have in your head, whether is the positive or negative side, is to write it down.",
      "That way you are taking the power away from the eating disorder.",
      "By slowly defeating the demon, it makes it easier to recover.",
      "The next step from there is to make sure you have a therapist.",

      "Parents have to be a role model, and when you purge every meal, that is not being a good parent.",

      "Fruits and veggies are low calories, and they give proper nutrients to your body, so the 7-10 servings of fruits and veggies they recommend a day actually only take up about 50-100 calories, because you are burning the low calories by eating, talking, getting out of your car, and daily activities.",
      "The next big mistake people make is protein.",
      "Protein is super heavy, but it helps your body burn calories, which is what we want!",
      "By eating 2-4 servings of protein a day, including protein powder, eggs, and other high protein foods, you are giving yourself healthy and natural energy, which help your body process other foods.",
      "Now with the furtive and veggies and protein, you are maybe at 300 calories so far for the day.",
      "That isn't that much, and even though that may be the limit for yourself, you are burning those 300 calories just from daily activities.",
      "This still isn't sustainable, but it's a start.",
      "To be honest with everyone, it is way harder then it seems.",
      "It is scary and you have to push yourself so much, but in the long run, being there for my daughter, able to support others, able to live, is enough motivation for me to get better.",

      "I've had awful anxiety ever since I was little, literally probably since 5 or 6 years old I have constantly worried about something, whether it be my extreme shyness/social anxiety, worrying about my parents dying one day, fear of being alone, relationship anxiety, religion anxiety, healthy anxiety, literally anything that has happened in my life I will obsess about to the point that I will cry and make myself sick over.",
      "One of the worst anxieties for me though, has been a fear of certain places.",
      "I think this one bothers me the most because its so ridiculous and irrational, at least all the other anxieties I have actually make sense, but having a fear of certain places makes it incredibly difficult to function as an adult and be \"normal\".",
      "The thing is is that theres not a specific type of place that makes my anxiety so bad, it can literally be anywhere and I cannot pinpoint what exactly is making me so anxious.",
      "For awhile it was places that were deserted, like out in the country or something but I have also been to places in the city that I'll go into and I will just wanna get out of there and never go back and even thinking about going there or the fact that the place even exists gives me insane anxiety..",
      "Trust me, I know this probably sounds crazy but please tell me if anyone has heard of this and if its some kind of phobia or what and if theres anything i can do to fix it or is this anxiety in general and feeling this way is \"normal\" for anxiety and depression.",

      "At this point, everything was fine up until this point so i just kinda avoided dealing with her all together so i could get it over with and leave.",
      "Well one day, she decides to open my door and watch what I'm doing.",

      "I start to recover now but I was very scared as these bad emotions brought me back to the days I couldn't function at all and decided to go to the doctor.It's not that I'm homesick or I miss them as it's not my best to go back.",
      "For some reason I feel uncomfortable around them although we don't have any serious issues as a family.",

      "The thing is though, when the breathing thing comes on sometimes really sudden i dont feel anxious until i feel like i can't breathe right- the chest, armpit pains and my heart beating fast are also scaring me and so is the fact that this happens EVERY single day and is starting to affect my daily life.",
      "Ive had a few panic attacks also which have just made me feel even worse and it takes me a day to feel a little bit better.",

      "It's the consistent struggling that makes me believe that I'm incapable of ever doing well.",
      "This is coupled with my friends succeeding in their social and job lives at just year 10-11, making me feel envious and incompetent.",
      "I've also felt suffocatingly lonely, balling up in bed to cope with the feeling.",
      "I am trying to socialise more often, though the interactions are feeling hollow, since I can't tell whether people enjoy my company, or just put up with me to not make a scene.",
      "I've felt this way since year 11, and still have no way of discerning between both cases.",
      "Hello everyone,     Soon I will be at an amusement park with a good friend, which for most people should be really exciting.",
      "But for me, I’m sitting up absolutely terrified that I’m going to die at the park.",
      "The reason for that is because even though I’ve had numerous tests done by 3 different hospitals, and they’ve all come back fine, I’m still terrified that I have an undetected heart condition that is going to kill me on a roller coaster.",
      "Recently, I’ve had terrible nighttime heartburn, and every now and again, maybe once or twice a day, I have palpitations.",

      "Being here really helps me being less judgemental today myself.",
      "Stay safe everyone and hope you're doing your best against your issues.",
      "Hi, this feeling that I’ve been having is like, if my anxiety is uncontrollable enough to feel like it’s not a part of me.",
      "Like if someone else switched a button that caused my brain to suddenly have catastrophic thoughts, and I don’t know how or just didn’t expect it to do that.",
      "The way my mind functions sometimes just doesn’t entirely “feel like me”, as if my mind had a mind of its own.",

      "I'm 27.",
      "I lost my job recently, and I'm now in a really stressful place of having to live with potentially emotionally abusive parents or find some other means; I'm even considering an emergency womens' shelter if I run out of friends to stay with.",
      "I really hope I can find a job asap, so I can get my own apartment again and keep my space from them.",
      ":(  Anyway, I felt morally bad about not standing up for the kids, but I didn't know how when I'm a guest in their house, and they probably won't take kindly to their parenting being criticized.",
      "Also I have social anxiety, and every time I don't speak up, because of the pressure on SA people to \"man-up\" and \"get over\" their anxiety, I feel like I'm a failure.",

      "I feel like my common sense and intelligence has gone, I used be able to read people and I used to listen to everyones problems and now im doing and saying the wrong things, people are now starting to take advantage of me, im scared to even apply for a job because I feel like im getting dumber and dumber each day by getting simple tasks wrong.",

      "I've had stable employment for over 10 years now and try to end each day ahead of the last.",
      "What alot of people don't see though, is my anxiety that makes me double check everything, it makes me doubt my ability and at times makes me feel like I'm going insane.",
      "I can only describe this as a feeling of my mind is stuck in an unrelenting, thick fog of madness.",
      "For 9 of these 10 years I've had a pretty good handle on things and have moved forward well, although the recent passing of my grandfather whome I was close with has turned everything upside down.",
      "let's go back, and I will keep it brief.",
      "I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder 10 years ago and put on medication, I was also smoking a considerable quantity of cannabis and drinking.",
      "This lasted 12 months before I crashed in an almighty collision of reality and what I'd been avoiding.",
      "I was put on a second medication, to which I had a rare reaction where I didn't sleep for 5 days and the sickness was almost unbearable, this combined with my grand ideas to stop smoking cannabis and stop taking the first medication all at once, leads me to my visit to the local Mental Health Hospital.",
      "I had a sneaky pill before they got to me to drag me out there so by the time I was being examined I was ok, and managed to talk my way out of it.",
      "Two days later I had a visit to a Psychiatrist who spoke with me at length and decided that a third medication was the correct medication for me.",
      "I was underweight, couldn't eat for days at a time and wasn't sleeping.",

      "When its bad, I feel like I'm losing my mind, like this is it and I'm about to say goodbye to my dwindling grip on reality.",

      "Even for simple things like brushing my teeth twice daily, eating at least three meals, having a shower or generally taking care of myself I just can't do it.",
      "I've been trying for years.",
      "They last a week or so tops then they stop.",
      "It's one thing people repeatedly say helps, to get into a routine, but I'm really struggling to manage it.",
      "If I cant even get into a routine to look after my basic needs then how am I supposed to be independent, get a job, and live a 'normal' life where I can provide for myself and take care of myself?",

      "I bit off a lot more than I can chew, and I've been very stressed about schoolwork since it started.",
      "However, that isn't the root of the issue of why I'm posting here...",
      "I've become a really awful person to my close friends, and I've pushed and isolated myself from everyone I knew outside of my family.",
      "A bad fight happened back in late August that ended up with me taking a break from my friend group.",
      "After the fight happened, I had to sit down and talk about the issue, and that fight was resolved, but no one was really talking to me still and they were avoiding me.",
      "They hung out with everyone else in the friend group normally, but whenever I came into the picture, things were always very tense.",
      "Due to my stress with schoolwork and the emotional toll of resolving the fight, I didn't have the energy to chase people down and ask what was wrong.",
      "I was really hurt and really sad - at one point in the week, two friends had close birthdays to one another and even had birthday parties to celebrate with everyone.",
      "But because of the fight, I didn't come.",
      "It was painful because I really love my friends and wanted to be with them, and I felt really left out.",
      "My mental health got worse over the course of those days following after, and I ended up going to my worst coping method and isolating myself.",
      "In a frenzy at 3AM, I unfriended everyone I knew on social media, cut off contact with everyone, and announced I was going off grid abruptly.",
      "Cut to a few weeks later, after being essentially friendless and alone and living with the consequences of my actions, I reached out to a few friends again and asked to communicate with me via text, instead of our typical social media sites.",
      "I wanted to have a connection again and realized my isolation was doing me worse than helping, and thought the few friends I contacted would be open to talking to me and begin to feel comfortable again if I merged slowly back into the group like this.",
      "They were, and things were fine for a bit - until I exploded at one friend that I was the closest to, and told her that it was a mistake to ask her to talk to me, because she felt so distant and unavailable compared to how we were before.",
      "She told me that she was busy and I was relying on her too much, and that although she wanted to support me, it was hard to adjust to this form of communication and things were hard adjusting in general after I cut her off and all our friends just like that, and expect things to be OK between us.",
      "I told her back that I just wanted things to feel normal again, and thought that I wasn't asking for much to just talk to her like we used to.",
      "She told me it was too much to ask, in the context of everything else, and that hurt.",
      "A lot.",
      "I left that conversation after, saying I couldn't give her the respect she was asking of me right then.",
      "I was really angry after that conversation.",
      "I felt really betrayed by her, and that everyone was out to get me.",
      "My life was falling apart everywhere else; I found out I have health issues that need to be treated, but I'm on a waitlist I don't know how long it's going to take (and reminder, struggling to even afford groceries right now), my classes were getting harder in harder in school.",
      "I had five tests coming in the next two weeks, and my teachers still expected us to do the same amount of homework we always do every other week, and I was working so hard every day to get good grades only to do badly.",
      "I was sad, lonely, and every day waking up was another reminder after reminder I was alone and it was my fault because I left all of my friends.",
      "I was miserable.",
      "To my mind, my friend telling me that it was too much to talk to her, and wws telling me I'm selfish and didn't think about other people.",
      "And all I could think of was how angry I was to be accused that.",
      "I went to my another friend I had reached out to to talk, and asked her if I was pressuring her to act normal around me, and that I was sorry if I was.",
      "This led to a conversation where she eventually told me that although it was uncomfortable, she would have rather have the discomfort talking to me than nothing at all.",
      "I brought up what our other friend said, saying how she said I was asking for too much, and shared what she said, and my friend got very angry at me.",
      "She told me I was twisting up what she said, and making it out to vilify her when she was just trying to help me.",
      "And that out of everyone, that friend of ours was the one that sat with me offering to help and took so much time out of her day to want to support me.",
      "I blew up at her back after, and denied twisting up our friend's words.",
      "I told her straight up that I was reading everything as very hostile right now, and that was how I read into her words.",
      "I wasn't trying to lie, but that it genuinely felt that way to me.",
      "I told her that nobody could help me right now (outside of therapy and meds I can't reach), and that I've been mentally unstable for a good few weeks now and suicidal, so that the person that would be reasonable and listen to logic right now wasn't here.",
      "I said that all I've been doing ever since September started is trying to survive day-by-day, and if she thought that I was being crazy and shutting down everyone trying to help me, then go ahead and do so, but to stop talking to me too.",
      "And all she sent in reply was a meme and \"bruh\" and left.",
      "I'm sorry this was so long.",
      "I just don't know how to explain this situation without everything else in context because it has so many layers.",
      "I don't want to be crying victim and say that it was all of my friends fault, and that they were wrong and I'm right.",
      "I don't want people to be biased to me.",
      "That's the last thing I want.",
      "I'm reaching another point in my depressive episode where I'm feeling somewhat stable again despite everything, and I'm just looking back in horror at everything I've done.",
      "I don't feel like me.",
      "I think my friends underestimated the amount of times I told them that I'm not mentally well right now.",
      "Usually, I'm a very calm person that listens to every side and considers people before myself.",
      "I always want to resolve things and make it better.",
      "I wasn't like that at all this time.",
      "The \"bruh\" my friend sent me makes me feel like a joke, and that everything I've gone through this past month has been something I should've been able to control.",
      "I feel so awful for twisting up my friend's words, because even if I felt that way, both of my friends were right.",
      "I was reading it wrong.",
      "I just feel so lost.",
      "I don't know if I should stay in that friend group anymore - not because of them, but because of me.",
      "I feel like I've walked past a point where I've burned too many bridges to come back.",
      "I feel crazy, but also still so angry and upset, but so lonely too.",
      "I want to apologize to them, but I'm still not in a place where I think I can without getting angry if they tell me (rightfully so) that how I acted was wrong and repeat the process all over again where I get salty and complain.",
      "I have to see if I can beg my family to help me (and feel like a burden on them) or wait to see if I can try to get a job and scrape up money to afford the therapy and meds myself.",
      "I still have all of my schoolwork I have to do and other responsibilities.",
      "I'm drowning and overworked and so tired and so sad and I just want to give up.",
      "Someone please help me.",
